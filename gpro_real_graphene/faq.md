# FAQ
Some common questions have been asked about my review of the Real Graphene G-Pro power bank: https://youtu.be/uIMegpibt1M

Since the review was not sponsored in anyway, I sent an email directly to Real Graphene to get seom clear answers

The questions I asked where:

- This is, in fact, a 15,000 mAh battery that just gets charged to 75% using standard fast charging.
- There is no graphene in the battery itself
- The graphene is just for cooling and nothing to do with the battery
- The Amazon listing says "Batteries: 4 Lithium Polymer batteries required. (included)"

Here are the answer directly from the founder and CEO:

## This is, in fact, a 15,000 mAh battery that just gets charged to 75% using standard fast charging.
15Ah batteries would be much bigger (about 50%). The case is heavy because of aluminum and glass on it and adds a lot of thickness to the model. If you stripped away all of the casing, you would see that the battery sizes aligns with 10Ah. It would be hard to prove this without showing our data sheets which are confidential unfortunately unless an NDA is signed with our customer.

Also, to get safety certifications such as FCC, CE and ROHS, the testing facility will test many things such as the capacity. We can not sell products that are different from the units provided for testing and the products we sell must match the certifications we've registered for. If we did in fact use 15Ah batteries and labeled them as 10Ah, it would be illegal under most of these governing bodies.

## There is no graphene in the battery itself
We manufacture for many different factories (cellphone, EV's and etc) and under their lab tests, our batteries exhibit incredibly high charging C rates (while retaining great power density), many more life cycles and a cooler temperature when charging. This alone should confirm the use of graphene as normal batteries would not nearly have these properties.

## The graphene is just for cooling and nothing to do with the battery
This is incorrect as we have extremely high charging C rates. To achieve high C rates for charging, you would need a drastic improvement on the electrodes. The graphene also works as heat dissipation in conjunction with its incredible conductivity in the electrode. To simply use a monolayer of graphene for cooling would be expensive, a waste of precious resources and wouldn't yield such a high performance increase. If you look online, graphene monolayer is incredibly expensive. (a 6 in. wafer is about $400 from most vendors). We manufacture graphene in a much more cost efficient way which allows us to utilize it so freely.

## The Amazon listing says "Batteries: 4 Lithium Polymer batteries required. (included)"
Our batteries are graphene-enhanced lithium. The main reason why we still use lithium is because it is easy to integrate into current systems since we use lithium AND it keeps the cost consumer friendly. We mix graphene nanoplateletes in the lithium mixture and we use monolayer(s) on the electrodes. Other products that claim to use graphene in fact use graphite or at the very most sprinkle a tiny bit of nanoplateletes into the lithium mixture. The fact we apply graphene in there two ways and are able to make it consumer cost friendly sets us apart from the competition.

Amazon also has a limited selection in choices we can choose so lithium-polymer is the closest we can describe this product. Amazon doesn't have a "graphene" section.
