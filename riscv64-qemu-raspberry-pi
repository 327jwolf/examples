# Introduction
Here are a few notes to help you get qemu running on a Raspberry Pi to emulate a RISC-V 64-bit processor in a virtual machine.

# Prerequisite
You will need a Raspberry Pi 4 with at least 4GB of RAM. This may also work on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 2GB of RAM, buit you will need to allocate the virtual machine less RAM.
Theorectically it work on a Raspnberry Pi 3, but RAM will be an issue.

Also, you will need to run a 64-bit version of Linux like Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for the Pi 4. It *may* work using the 64-bit version of Raspberry Pi OS.
