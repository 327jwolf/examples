# How to create Network Attached Storage (NAS) using a Raspberry Pi

Just about any Single Board Computer (SBC) like a Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, ODROID or NVIDIA Jetson can be used to create Network Attached Storage (NAS). Really the only prerequisites are that the board can run Linux, has a USB port, and has networking. After that, it just comes down to performance.

To build a Raspberry Pi-powered NAS is quite simple. Here is a step-by-step guide.

## Assumptions
This guide concentrates on the NAS parts of the overall system build, therefore I assume that you have already:

1. Installed a Debian/Ubuntu-based OS on your board. In the base of the Raspberry Pi than means Raspberry Pi OS, for something like the NVIDIA Jetson then you should install Jetpack.
2. Configured a static IP address (this is optional, but recommended)
3. Enabled SSH access to the board
4. Set the board to boot to the command line and not the desktop (to save memory on smaller boards).

## Set the host name.

## Install SAMBA
Install - sudo apt install samba
(Modify smb.conf to use WINS settings from DHCP - YES)

## Prep the hard drive

Prep the hard drive
Find it (lsblk)
Check if already mounted
df -h
/dev/sda1 mounted on /media/pi/â€¦..
If it is already formatted then skip the following
Partition it
Format it
## Create the directories
Create a top-level directory
Create a new user (adduser)
Chown to user (e.g. p)
Edit /etc/fstab
## Configure SAMBA
Edit /etc/samba/smb.conf
Add smb user (smbpasswd -a gary)
## Spin down when IDLE
Method 1
sudo apt install hdparm
sudo hdparm -S 60 /dev/sda
(Values between 1 to 240 work in 5 second steps, so 60 is 5 minutes)
Method 2
wget https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/hd-idle/hd-idle-1.04.tgz
tar -zxvf hd-idle-1.04.tgz
cd hd-idle
sudo apt install debhelper
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
sudo dpkg -i ../hd-idle_*.deb
sudo vi /etc/default/hd-idle
START_HD_IDLE=true
HD_IDLE_OPTS="-i 180 -l /var/log/hd-idle.log"
